# Python Allocation Analyzer

## Requirements
You must use python 3.6+ 

_Should work on windows and linux with python. 
So you can run this from the OpsCenter VM if you choose._

## Install required Package
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Edit the config.json 
After running the program once it should create a blank config.json 
for you with some defaults populated. You can then just edit this 
and update it with the details of your installation.



## Run the program
<python3.6+> get_ldev_data.py

## Collect the Report
It should override the report.csv file every time containing the report.

## Troubleshooting
When running the program it should create a log file application_output.log. 
Review it for any errors or send it to the administrator.
